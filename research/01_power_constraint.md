# AI Infrastructure Capital Allocation Research Framework

## Module 1: Power Constraint Thesis Validation

**Investment research question:** How should long-term investors evaluate capital allocation across the AI infrastructure value chain if power availability becomes a binding constraint on deployment?

**Validation question:** Is the power-constraint hypothesis sufficiently supported by current evidence to justify further research?

**Working conclusion:** Current evidence suggests that power availability should be treated as a credible investment constraint for AI infrastructure. However, the severity of that constraint is regional, scenario-dependent, and subject to meaningful execution uncertainty.

**Research positioning:** This module is not intended to provide investment recommendations. Instead, it evaluates whether the underlying thesis is sufficiently supported to justify further research into regional power markets, infrastructure value chains, and long-term capital allocation.

## Research Note

### 1. Investment Research Question

**How should long-term capital allocation across the AI infrastructure value chain change if power availability becomes a binding deployment constraint?**

This module does not attempt to answer that question directly. Instead, it evaluates whether the underlying power-constraint thesis is sufficiently supported to justify further investment research.

If the hypothesis remains credible, subsequent modules examine where constraints emerge, why they differ across regions, and which infrastructure segments warrant further economic analysis.

---

### 2. Evidence Summary

Across the available evidence, one pattern appears consistently. Electricity demand associated with AI infrastructure is expected to increase materially over the remainder of the decade, even though individual forecasts differ in pace, timing, and ultimate scale.

The strongest evidence comes from IEA, DOE/LBNL, EPRI, and NERC. Together, these sources suggest that U.S. data center electricity consumption is likely to increase materially over the remainder of the decade, although the magnitude varies across scenarios. Rather than relying on a single forecast, this framework treats multiple scenario ranges as inputs to the investment thesis.

For this project, the next question is whether reliable power can be delivered where and when new AI infrastructure is being built. The repository does not establish that this is more important than every other deployment constraint.

The reviewed evidence points to regional variation. Among the three regions selected for initial comparison, PJM shows concentrated data-center load growth, particularly in Northern Virginia. ERCOT exhibits rapid projected load growth but applies significant adjustments to requested large-load additions based on observed project realization. CAISO presents a useful comparison because its planning framework incorporates large-load growth differently and currently projects more moderate near-term demand in the cited source.

Taken together, the evidence supports continued investigation into regional power constraints rather than a single national conclusion.

---

### 3. What the Evidence Supports

The available evidence supports several preliminary observations.

Speed-to-power is becoming a more important competitive factor for AI infrastructure deployment.

Transmission availability, interconnection timelines, substations, transformers, and local grid capacity may become binding constraints even in regions where aggregate generation appears sufficient.

If power availability increasingly determines where AI infrastructure can be deployed, then assets that support faster access to reliable power may deserve more research attention than assets exposed only to higher compute demand.

National electricity forecasts are useful for context. For investment analysis, the more important variables are likely to be regional conditions, utility practices, and local infrastructure constraints.

### 4. What Remains Uncertain

The overall thesis is supported, but several uncertainties could still affect the investment implications.

The first is the scale of future electricity demand. Forecasts may overstate realized demand if they include speculative projects, double-count announced developments, or assume projects come online faster than they actually do. ERCOT's adjustment methodology, which reduces requested large-load demand based on observed realization rates, is a useful reminder that announced capacity should not be treated as firm demand.

AI efficiency is another open question. Improvements in semiconductor design, model architecture, inference optimization, cooling technologies, and workload management could reduce energy intensity over time. Those gains could also be offset by wider AI adoption, larger models, and higher inference volumes. The net effect remains unclear.

Regional policy and utility practices are still evolving. Large-load tariffs, interconnection reform, cost allocation rules, behind-the-meter generation, and utility planning processes could all influence where new AI infrastructure can be deployed and which regions attract investment.

These uncertainties do not invalidate the thesis. They explain why regional analysis and regular evidence updates remain important to the research framework.

### 5. Research Decision Framework

At this stage, power availability should be treated as a research variable rather than an established investment conclusion.

The purpose of this module is not to determine which companies or assets should outperform. Instead, it establishes a repeatable process for evaluating whether power availability is likely to become a meaningful driver of infrastructure investment.

Identify Constraint Drivers

```

This framework shifts the research process from validating a macro thesis toward evaluating where evidence is strongest, how constraints propagate through the infrastructure value chain, and how those observations may eventually influence long-term capital allocation.

---

### 6. Initial Thesis Review Conclusion

The evidence reviewed in this module supports a narrower conclusion: power availability should be treated as a credible research variable for AI infrastructure over the coming decade.

That does not mean every region faces the same level of risk, or that every announced project will be built. The evidence does suggest that power availability is becoming more important in determining where AI infrastructure can be deployed, how quickly projects can move forward, and which infrastructure assets may become relevant.

The hypothesis warrants continued research, with one important qualification: power availability is regional and scenario-dependent, not a uniform national shortage.

With that premise established, the research can now shift from asking whether the constraint exists to examining where it is most significant, why it emerges, and how those differences may influence long-term capital allocation across the AI infrastructure value chain.

This initial review does not establish an investment view. It establishes only that power availability should be included as an explicit analytical variable in later research.
